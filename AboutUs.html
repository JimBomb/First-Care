Today, First Care has touched the lives of over 45 million patients from 121
countries. The group, which started from the acm hackathon, is now recognized as a 
pioneer of private healthcare websites in India, with 64 websites in operation. First Care is 
known not only as a medical website but has emerged as an integrated healthcare 
provider in Asia, specializing also in consultancy, clinics, pharmacy, insurance and 
holistic therapy.

The very first First Care was established in Jaipur, in 2018 by JDK-H group, 
with the mission to bring world-class healthcare consiltancy to India at a price 
point that Indians could afford. Before First Care, only certain individuals had the 
privilege for quality medical council as they could afford to travel abroad. The 
establishment that First Care offer patients, the same level of quality treatment at 
only a fraction of the global prices, led to a revolution in medical council in India. Until 
today, this cost consciousness approach continues to be a building block of the 
hospital’s healthcare strategy.

In addition, the company is built on lasting value systems that focuses on excellence, 
expertise, empathy and innovation. The JDK-H Group was the first to invest in pre-
requisites for international quality accreditations such as the JCI and to develop centres 
of excellence Cardiac Sciences, Orthopaedics, Neurosciences, Emergency Care, Cancer 
and Organ Transplantation. Stringent internal processes and scoring systems ensures 
the group achieves the very best qualities. First Care took initiatives including the 
ACE@25 and TASSC, conveying a commitment to global benchmarks and clinical 
excellence.
